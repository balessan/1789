Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen
===================================================

This script is an experiment to translate two first articles of the "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" to PHP as a functional code. It demonstrates the ability to make intellectual concept work in an operational context, and also the usefulness of the code to expect concepts to be as precise as possible.

The result of the index file should return something like this :

"Article I - Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions can be founded only on the common good."

- Human one is free : 1
- Human two is free : 1
- Humans ar equal in rights : 1
- Humans ar equal in another context :

"Article II - The goal of any political association is the conservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, safety and resistance against oppression."

- Man imprescriptible rights : human_rights_1789\natural_imprescriptible_rights
- Man rights are imprescriptible rights ? : 1
- And the rights are ?
  - right_liberty
  - right_property
  - right_security
  - right_resistance_to_oppression
